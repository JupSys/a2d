Apple II Desktop - Desk Accessories
===================================

Installation
------------

If using a physical Apple II with actual floppy disks, transfer the
DeskAccessories.po. file to a floppy using ADTPro. If using a floppy
emulator, copy the file to your storage medium.

1. Boot into Apple II Desktop.
2. Insert the disk with the desk accessories.
3. Drag the files into your A2.DESKTOP/DESK.ACC folder.
4. Reboot.

Tip: You can use the Sort Directory DA to order the files, which controls
the menu order:

* Open the A2.DESKTOP/DESK.ACC folder
* Hold Open-Apple and click on each file in the desired order
* Select Sort Directory from the Apple menu, and verify the order
* Restart
