# ProDOS Related

* Certain features are known to fail with versions of ProDOS before 1.1. Booting with a newer version is recommended.

# Hardware Specific

* The M0100 mouse is known to have compatibility issues with the //c and IIc+ where the mouse may not be detected, or one axis may stop being measured. This is due to a hardware problem affecting only some mice with that model number. Mice with models starting with A2 should function correctly. (This problem is not specific to Apple II DeskTop.)
