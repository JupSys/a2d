## Font

* Default font is 9 pixels tall, proportional spaced.

## Modal Dialogs

* Interior border
  * 2x4 pixels thick.
  * Offset 2x4 pixels from the window frame.
  * Drawn with solid black pen (not XOR).

## Buttons

* Default size for buttons with text labels is 101px x 12px, counting the border.
  * This gives 1px padding above the text, 0px below (counting descenders).
* Border is 1x1 pixels thick, drawn with XOR pen to give subtly rounded corners.
* Horizontal text inset is 5px.
* Vertical text position is 10px (just above bottom border).
* Displaying keyboard shortcuts is controlled with a user preference.
  * If disabled:
    * Label should be aligned centered.
  * If enabled:
    * Label should be aligned left.
    * Keyboard shortcut should be aligned right.
    * Indicate default action with carriage return glyph ‚èé.
    * Indicate cancel action with Esc.
* Arrow buttons to increment or decrement values can be non-default height.

* Horizontal text inset is 5px.
* Vertical text position is 10px (just above bottom border).
* Caret (a.k.a. insertion point) is the full height of field, XOR-drawn between text glyphs. Moving the caret does not cause the string to change.
* The following keyboard shortcuts are supported:
  * Left Arrow - move caret one character left.
  * Right Arrow - move caret one character right.
  * Apple+Left Arrow - move caret to start of text.
  * Apple+Right Arrow - move caret to end of string.
  * Delete - erase character to the left of the caret.
  * Control+F - erase character to the right of the caret.
